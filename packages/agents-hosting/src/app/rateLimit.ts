 * Defines how a rate limit rule groups incoming activities by scope key.

 * selected for the turn. Use {@link RateLimitRule.appliesTo} to decide whether a
 * rule should participate; use `scope` to decide which user, conversation,
 * tenant, or other key should be counted.
 *
 * If a rule applies and the scope returns `undefined` or an empty string, the
 * turn is throttled. This avoids silently bypassing a limit when the scope key
 * cannot be derived.
 *
 * @example Per-user key:
 * ```ts
 * scope: (context) => context.activity.from?.id
 * ```
 *
 * @example Per-conversation key:
 * ```ts
 * scope: (context) => context.activity.conversation?.id

 * @example Per-user-per-conversation key:
 * ```ts
 * scope: (context) => `${context.activity.from?.id}:${context.activity.conversation?.id}`

 *

 * - at 1s and 2s, the second and third matching activities are accepted
 * - at 3s, the fourth matching activity is throttled with `retryAfterMs` near 7000
 * - at 10s, the window has expired and the next accepted activity starts a new window

 * @example Limit all activities per user:
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   scope: (context) => context.activity.from?.id,

 *   limit: 20,
 *   windowMs: 60_000

 *   scope: (context) => context.activity.from?.id,
