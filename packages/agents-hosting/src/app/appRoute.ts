 *
 * @remarks
 * An AppRoute defines how incoming activities are matched and processed by combining
 * a selector function that determines when the route should be activated with a handler
 * function that processes the matched activities.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const echoRoute: AppRoute<MyTurnState> = {
 *   selector: (activity) => activity.type === 'message',
 *   handler: async (context, state) => {
 *     await context.sendActivity(`You said: ${context.activity.text}`);
 *   }
 * };
 * ```
