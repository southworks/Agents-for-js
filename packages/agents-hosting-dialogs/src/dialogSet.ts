/**
 * Interface for dialogs that have child dialog dependencies.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Implement this interface on dialog classes that need to register child dialogs
 * with their parent dialog set. When a dialog implementing this interface is added
 * to a DialogSet, the DialogSet will automatically call getDependencies() and add
 * all returned child dialogs to itself, ensuring proper dialog registration and
 * avoiding runtime errors when the dialog tries to call child dialogs.
 *
 * This is particularly useful for complex dialogs that compose multiple sub-dialogs
 * or for dialog libraries that need to ensure their dependencies are available.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * class MyComplexDialog extends Dialog implements DialogDependencies {
 *   private textPrompt = new TextPrompt('textPrompt');
 *   private confirmPrompt = new ConfirmPrompt('confirmPrompt');
 *
 *   getDependencies(): Dialog[] {
 *     return [this.textPrompt, this.confirmPrompt];
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

   * This method is called automatically by DialogSet.add() when a dialog implementing
   * this interface is added to the set. All returned dialogs will be recursively
   * added to the same DialogSet, ensuring they are available when needed during
   * dialog execution.
   *
   * The returned dialogs should be the actual Dialog instances that will be called
   * by this dialog, not new instances. This ensures proper dialog lifecycle management
   * and state consistency.
