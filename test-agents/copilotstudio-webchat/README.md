# Copilot Studio WebChat Integration Sample

This sample demonstrates how to connect Microsoft Copilot Studio to a custom WebChat interface using the [Bot Framework WebChat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/botframework-webchat) component. It provides a full-stack example, including backend authentication and conversation management, as well as a modern frontend chat UI.

## Overview

This sample contains a ready-to-run example for integrating Copilot Studio bots with a web-based chat client. It uses the Power Platform API for secure communication and token acquisition, and leverages the Bot Framework WebChat for the frontend experience.

### Folder Structure

- **copilotstudio/**: Contains backend logic for authenticating with Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), acquiring tokens, and communicating with the Copilot Studio API.
- **webchat/**: Contains the frontend code for rendering the chat UI using Bot Framework WebChat and connecting to the backend via a custom DirectLine-like adapter.

## 1. Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 20 or higher  
   ```bash
   node --version
   ```
2. An Agent created in Microsoft Copilot Studio or access to an existing Agent.
3. Ability to create an App Registration in Azure, or access to an existing one with the `CopilotStudio.Copilots.Invoke` API Permission assigned.

## 2. Create an Agent in Copilot Studio

1. Create an Agent in [Copilot Studio](https://copilotstudio.microsoft.com).
    1. Publish your newly created Copilot.
    2. Go to **Settings > Advanced > Metadata** and copy the following values for later:
        - Schema name
        - Environment Id

## 3. Create an Application Registration in Entra ID

This step requires permissions to create application identities in your Azure tenant. For this sample, create a Native Client Application Identity (no secrets required):

1. Open [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Navigate to Entra ID.
3. Create a new App Registration:
    1. Provide a Name.
    2. Choose "Accounts in this organization directory only".
    3. In "Select a Platform", choose "Public Client/native (mobile & desktop)".
    4. In the Redirect URI box, enter `http://localhost` (**use HTTP, not HTTPS**).
    5. Click Register.
4. In your new application:
    1. On the Overview page, note:
        - Application (client) ID
        - Directory (tenant) ID
    2. Go to **API Permissions** in the Manage section.
    3. Click **Add Permission**:
        1. In the side panel, click the `APIs my organization uses` tab.
        2. Search for `Power Platform API` or `8578e004-a5c6-46e7-913e-12f58912df43`.
            - *If you do not see `Power Platform API`, see the note below.*
        3. In *Delegated permissions*, choose `CopilotStudio` and check `CopilotStudio.Copilots.Invoke`.
        4. Click **Add Permissions**.
    4. (Optional) Click **Grant Admin consent** for your app.

> [!TIP]  
> If you do not see `Power Platform API` in the list, you need to add it to your tenant. See [Power Platform API Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/programmability-authentication-v2#step-2-configure-api-permissions) and follow Step 2 to add the API.

## 4. Configure the Example Application

1. Open the [env.TEMPLATE](./copilotstudio/env.TEMPLATE) and rename it to .env.
2. Fill in the values you recorded during setup:
    - `environmentId`: The Copilot Studio Environment Id.
    - `agentIdentifier`: The Copilot Studio Schema name.
    - `tenantId`: The App Registration Directory (tenant) ID.
    - `appClientId`: The App Registration Application (client) ID.

## 5. Setup and Running the Sample

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the sample:**
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
   or for development with hot reload:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   - Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to interact with your Copilot Studio bot via the WebChat interface.


## 6. How It Works

- The backend (`index.js` and `copilotstudio/`) authenticates users via Azure AD and securely acquires tokens to interact with Copilot Studio APIs.
- The frontend (`webchat/`) uses Bot Framework WebChat to provide a chat interface, connecting to the backend through a custom adapter that mimics the DirectLine protocol.

## 7. Folder Details

### copilotstudio/

- Handles authentication with Azure AD using MSAL.
- Manages token acquisition and refresh.
- Provides API endpoints for starting conversations and sending activities to Copilot Studio.

### webchat/

- Implements the chat UI using Bot Framework WebChat.
- Connects to the backend using a custom connection class that translates between WebChat and Copilot Studio APIs.

## 8. Additional Notes

- Ensure your Azure AD app registration has the necessary API permissions for Power Platform.
- The backend uses [Vite](https://vite.dev/) to serve the frontend and Express to provide API endpoints.
    - **Note:** The integration between WebChat and the Copilot Studio client is independent of the build tool. Vite and Express are used here to simplify the sample code.
    - You can use any communication strategy, as long as:
        - The Copilot Studio client is hosted in a Node.js environment.
        - The WebChat frontend code is served to the browser.
- This sample is intended for development and demonstration purposes. For production, review authentication flows and security best practices.


## 9. Authentication

The Copilot Studio Client requires a user token to operate. This sample uses a user interactive flow to get the user token for the application ID created above.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> The token is cached on the user machine in `$TEMP/mcssample.usercache.json`.

## 10. Troubleshooting

- **Token Acquisition Errors:** If you see errors related to token acquisition, verify your `.env` configuration and Azure AD app registration permissions.
- **CORS Issues:** The backend is configured to allow CORS for local development. If you encounter CORS errors, ensure your frontend is served from the expected origin.
- **API Permissions:** Double-check that your Azure AD app registration has the correct API permissions and if needed the admin consent has been granted.
- **Agent Not Responding:** Ensure your Copilot Studio bot is published and the identifiers in your `.env` file are correct.
